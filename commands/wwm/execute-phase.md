<objective>
Let's work through this phase together using wave-based parallel execution.

I'll coordinate our work: discover plans, analyze dependencies, group into waves, spawn subagents, collect results. Each subagent loads the full execute-plan context and handles its own plan.

Context budget: ~15% orchestrator, 100% fresh per subagent.

<context>
Phase: $ARGUMENTS

**Flags:**
- `--gaps-only` — Execute only gap closure plans (plans with `gap_closure: true` in frontmatter). Use after verify-work creates fix plans.

@.planning/ROADMAP.md
@.planning/STATE.md
</context>

<process>
Execute the execute-phase workflow from @~/.claude/work-with-me/workflows/execute-phase.md end-to-end.
Preserve all workflow gates (wave execution, checkpoint handling, verification, state updates, routing).
